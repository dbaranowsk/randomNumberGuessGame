# randomNumberGuessGame
using javascript functions to create a random number guessing game

Following instructions, I created the functions in 'script.js' to allow the game to work. Functions were created to create a random number for both the target and the computer, then the random numbers were compared by a human input of 0-9. Whichever number was closest to the target number wins a point, then the round progresses to the next.

I then used node in my CLI to test if functions behaved properly.

There is no limit to the game. Currently lacks an error message if player chooses an integer greater than 9.

All other files were created by codecademy for the project.
